# ScriptableObjectWizard

This is a tool for anyone who's tired of having to add [CreateAssetMenu] to all scriptable objects they make. A simple editor window that allows you to create an instance of any concrete type that inherits from ScriptableObject. It features an assembly filter and a search function, to speed up the asset creation process.

The wizard is available via the MiddleMast/ScriptableObject Wizard option in the toolbar
